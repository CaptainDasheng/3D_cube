# 3D_cube
The repository contains a set of python codes which are responsible for generation of a 3D cubic structure of ferroelectric ceramics. The structure is further transferred to the FlexPDE which solved kinetic and Laplace's equations. There are also codes which calculates correlations and electric field distributions in an investigated system.
