Folders
Cube_codes - contains all python scripts
cube - contains generated structure

Symmetry and amount of cubes have to be set in the "Cube_codes\start.lxml" file.
All materials parameters including angle distribution function will be automatically arranged for the chosen symmetry.

First, you need to generate a structure and an applied field map. To this end

command line | bash ./runs
(a)mean <cos> value will appear on the screen
(b)"FlexPDE file is ready" will appear on the screen
(c) uv.dat with data regarding an applied field map will appear in the "cube" folder

Then, the generated structure and the applied field map will be used to simulate structure with polarization, so that
command line | bash ./runr
a fully polarized system will first time be polarized providing .dat files at required moments of time

command line | bash ./runr <---- voltage has to be changed
to the repolarized system in the new direction 

after 2 repolarizations system is stable and can be studied

IMPORTANT: time at which .dat file is expected should be set in the .pde file
       data for correlations and other analysis is optionally set in the .pde - the necessary script's lines comprised in the python script
