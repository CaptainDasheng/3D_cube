Folders
Cube_codes - contains all python scripts
cube - contains generated structure

Symmetry and amount of cubes have to be set in the "Cube_codes\start.lxml" file.
All materials parameters including angle distirbution function will be aoutomatically aragned for the choosen symmetry.

First you need to generate a structure and an applied field map. To this end

command line | bash ./runs
(a)mean <cos> value will appear on the screen
(b)"FlexPDE file is ready" will appear on the screen
(c) uv.dat with data regarding an apllined fiel map will appear in the "cube" folder

Then, the generated structure and the applied field map will be used to symmulate structure with polarization, so that
command line | bash ./runr
a fully polarized system will first time be polorizaed providing .dat files at requared moments of time

command line | bash ./runr <---- voltage has to be changed
to repolarized system in the new direction 

after 2 repolarizations system is stable and can be studyed

IMPORTANT: time at wich .dat file is expected should be set in the .pde file
	   data for correlations and other ananlysis is optionaly setted in the .pde - the nessesarly scripts lines comprized in the python script
